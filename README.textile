h1. YouTube Model

This plugin allows you to interact with the new YouTube API (yes, that means uploading is now featured)
through a simple ActiveResource model.

h2. Patch for Rails 2.1.1

There was a change in Rails 2.1.1 that causes a **406 Not Acceptable HTTP error**. There is a patch
to solve this though.

Just apply the patch to your frozen copy of rails:

  curl http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/attachments/46005/accept_http_header.diff | git am

h3. Installing

Simply as:

  ./script/plugin install git://github.com/edgarjs/youtube-model.git

h3. Generating the model

The plugin includes a generator to create a model based on ActiveResource

  ./script/generate youtube_model <ModelName>

This generator will create a file under the app/models directory. It is not an ActiveRecord model but an
ActiveResource. (To see more about ActiveResource check out the
"Rails API":http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveResource.html

h3. Listing videos

Let's say you generated a model named YouTube. So now you can use that model very similar
to an ActiveRecord model.

To search for videos passing a simple query use the method @find@

  YouTube.find('rails conference 2008')

To get the videos uploaded by a user you can use the method @uploaded_by@ passing the username

  YouTube.uploaded_by('envyads')

And so on. To see the full list of available methods see the "Wikis":http://github.com/edgarjs/youtube-model/wikis

All methods will return an instance of @Entry@. The @Entry@ object encapsulates information about a video, playlist,
suscription, contact or other entity. This class is parsed from the @<entry>@ tag of the xml response, wich is the root
tag in all YouTube data API requests. (To see more about the structure of the xml response go
to the "YouTube API":http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/developers_guide_protocol.html#Understanding_Video_Entries

The returned Entry instance has a main mehod: **video** (alias for **videos**), wich is an easy-to-remember alias for @entry@.

**Example**

  <pre><code>
  # controller:
  @tube = YouTube.find('ruby on rails', :max_results => 5)
  
  # view:
  <h1><%= @tube.title %></h1>
  <% @tube.videos.each do |video| -%>
    <%= youtube_embed video %>
  <% end -%>
  </code></pre>

As you can see, the @youtube_embed@ method is used to display a video.
