==Sinopsis
YouTubeModel allows you to generate an ActiveResource model ready to interact with the You Tube API.

==Repository
    git://github.com/edgarjs/youtube-model.git

==Home
    http://rails.mimbles.net

==Installing
    ./script/plugin install http://svn.mimbles.net/rails/plugins/you_tube_model

==Using the plugin
To generate the You Tube model just run this generator passing the model name:

    ./script/generate youtube_model MyModelName

Then you are ready. You can retrieve video information from You Tube.

==Examples

Let's say you generated a youtube_model named YouTube...

To search for videos use the method +find+:
    YouTube.find('my search query here')

Or you can retrieve the videos uploaded by a user passing the username as param:
    YouTube.uploaded_by('someusername')

Or if you want to get the top rated videos for today:
    YouTube.top_rated(:today)

In these examples you will get an object as result even if there are more than one
video in the result. This is because the object is "parsed" from the xml respond.

So if you read the {YouTube API}[http://code.google.com/apis/youtube/developers_guide_protocol.html]
you'll see the proper way to get the information
you want. Just to make the start easy, you can get the videos with the method
+video+ or +videos+ (that actually is just an easy-to-remember name for +entry+).

    # controller:
    @yt = YouTube.find('ruby on rails', :orderby => :rating) # this is a YouTube object

    # view:
    <h1><%= @yt.title %></h1>
    <%# And @yt.videos returns an array (if there're more than 1) of YouTube#Entry %>
    <% @yt.videos.each do |video| -%>
	<%= youtube_embed video %>
    <% end -%>

As you can see, you use the helper <tt>youtube_embed</tt> to display the video.
